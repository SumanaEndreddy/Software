============Known bugs, issues or limitations=================

I believe the program is working fine and that there are no bugs or issues. 
As of now, when I execute the code using the input files I created, 
the number of students and the number of course sections that can be run, 
both of which are included in output text file 3, displays 0 as a value. 
Zero would have not been displayed if I had added more data to the input files.

Names of the input files I created are:
1. StudentsRequests.csv
2. Courses_Sections.csv
